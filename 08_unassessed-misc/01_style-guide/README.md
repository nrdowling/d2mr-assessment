# Mini-project: Misc. | Style guide

Primary skills/categories targeted:

- Assessed: 22
- Unassessed: 5, 12, 13

## Description

In this project, you will create and document your own style guide and practice following it.

## Instructions

This project is fully open-ended and you can approach it however you like. Although you are free to get creative, your project should *probably* minimally contain:

1. Documentation for the style guide. Refer to the tidyverse style guide, Dr. Dowling’s style guide, and the many many other examples online to see what things belong in a style guide and how to document them.
2. A document (such as an R notebook) that demonstrates the use of each feature of your style guide. I suggest using ample comments to call attention to where you are using each feature.
3. Some additional explanation and/or reflection in the assessment document (or even built into the document that uses the style!) walking through the choices you made and the reasoning behind them.

Your style guide may be modeled after existing guides, but should have notable and obvious differences. If you think an existing style guide is already perfect, you could approach this project as creating a reasonable alternative, even if it’s not one that you’d like to use yourself.

### Challenge suggestions

To make things trickier, show more skills, or earn engagement points, try one or more of the following:

1. Apply your style guide to more than a single document, like a full project repo.
2. Combine this with one or more other mini-projects, so you apply the style you create and document to all elements of the other project(s).
3. Expand your style guide beyond the kinds of things you see in examples. For example, you could add standards for ggplot themes or elements, yaml header organization, commit message structure, etc.
4. Make two style guides, a “good” one that follows best practices and would be useful for you or others and a second “bad” one that is poorly constructed, inconsistent, difficult to implement, etc. In a document or your assessment file, give a thoughtful comparison of the two and explain why the latter guide is in fact functionally “bad.”

## Submission

**Reminder:** You can submit this as its own mini-project following the instructions below, or you can combine all or part of this project with one or more other mini-projects. It may be easier to demonstrate a range of skills by creating and following a style guide within something like a class topic demo (05_03) or a data analysis project (04_01, 04_02) than doing this one in isolation.

1. Copy the `assessment.md` doc from your top-level directory into this project subdirectory.
2. Complete the assessment document.
3. On Canvas, go to the next available open mini-project assignment. In the text box, include:
    1. The name of the project and/or a brief description of the project
    2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project
        1. If you completed the project in a separate repository, your `assessment.md` file in the subdirectory should explain how to access your work.
    3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know
4. Submit the Canvas assignment. Your grader will access the directory you've linked to, grade your work on the assessment doc, push the doc back to your repository, and mark your Canvas assignment as complete.
